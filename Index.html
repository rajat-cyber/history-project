                <p>The Vijayanagara empire was founded in 1336. In the wake of the revolutions against Tughluq in the Deccan, the Hindu empire lasted for more than two centuries.
                   Its history and properties were built by the increasing militarization of Peninsular politics, after the Muslim invasions and the propitiation that made southern 
                   India a major participant in the trade network associating Europe and East Asia. Urbanization and monetization of the economy were the two other significant developments
                    of the period that brought all the peninsular kingdoms into highly competitive, political, and military activities in the race for supremacy.</p>

                <p>The Kingdom of Vijayanagar was founded by Harihara and Bukka, two of five brothers(surnamed Sangama) who had served in the administrations of both Kakatiya and Kampili
                   before those kingdoms were conquered by the battalions of the Delhi sultanate in the 1320s. When Kampili fell in 1327, the two brothers are believed to have been captured
                    and taken to Delhi, where they were converted to Islam. They were returned to the Devvan as governors of Kampili for the Sultanate with the hope that they would be able to 
                    deal with the many local revolts and invasions by neighboring Hindu kings. They followed a conciliatory policy toward the landholders of the area, many of whom had not accepted 
                    Muslim rule, and began a process of consolidation and expansion. Their first campaign was against the neighboring Hoysala king, Ballala III of Dorasamudra, but it stagnated; after 
                    the brothers reconverted to Hinduism under the influence of the sage Madhavacarya (Vidyaranya) and proclaimed their independence from the Delhi Sultanate. However, they were able to 
                    defeat Ballala and thereby secure their home base. Harihara I (reigned 1336-56) then established his new capital, Vijayanagar, in an easily defensible position south of the Tungabhadra 
                    River, where it came to symbolize the emerging medieval political culture of India. The kingdom's expansion in the first century of its existence made it the first Indian state to exercise 
                    enduring control over different linguistic and cultural regions, albeit with subregional and local chiefly powers exercising authority as its agents and subordinates.</p>

                <div class="row"><div class="col-7"><img src="_1.jpeg"></div><div class="col-5">
                <p>In 1336, Harihara, with the help of his brother, held uneasy suzerainty over lands extending from Nellore, on the southeast coast, to Badami, south of Bijapur on the western side of the Deccan. All around him, new Hindu kingdoms were rising, the most important of which were the Hoysala kingdom of Ballala and the Andhra Confederacy, led by Kapaya Nayaka. However, Ballala's kingdom was disadvantageously situated between the Ma'bar sultanate and Vijayanagar, and within two years after Ballala was killed by the sultan in 1343-44, his kingdom had been conquered by Bukka, Harihara's brother, and annexed to Vijayanagar. This was the most important victory of Harihara's reign; the new state now could claim sovereignty from sea to sea, and in 1346 the five brothers attended a great celebration at which Bukka was made joint ruler and heir.  Harihara’s brothers made other, less compelling conquests of small Hindu kingdoms during the next decade.However, the foundation of the Bahmanī Sultanate in 1347 created a new and greater danger, and Harihara was forced to lessen his own expansionist activities to meet the threat posed by this powerful and aggressive new state on his northern borders. During Harihara’s reign, the administrative foundation of the Vijayanagar state was laid.</p>
                  </div><p> Borrowing from the Kakatiya kings he had served, he created administrative units called stholas, nadus, and simas and appointed officials to collect revenue and to carry on local administration, preferring Brahmans to men of other castes. The income of the state apparently was increased by the reorganization, although centralization probably did not proceed to the stage where salaried officials collected directly for the government in most areas. Rather, most land remained under the direct control of subordinate chiefs or of a hierarchy of local landholders, who paid some revenue and provided some troops for the king. Harihara also encouraged increased cultivation in some areas by allowing lower revenue payments for lands recently reclaimed from the forests.

                <h2>Consolidation</h2>
                <h5>Title description, Sep 2, 2017</h5>
                <div class="row"><div class="col-5"><img src="Vijayanagara.jpeg"></div><div class="col-7">
                <p>Harihara was succeeded by Bukka (I; reigned 1356–77), who during his first decade as king engaged in a number of costly wars against the Bahmanī sultans over control of strategic forts in the Tungabhadra-Krishna Doab, as well as over the trading emporium of the east and west coasts. The Bahmanīs generally prevailed in these encounters and even forced Vijayanagar to pay a tribute in 1359. The major accomplishments of Bukka’s reign were the conquest of the short-lived sultanate of Maʿbar (Madurai; 1370) and the maintenance of his kingdom against the threat of decentralization. During Harihara’s reign, the government of the outlying provinces of the growing state had been entrusted to his brothers—usually, to the brother who had conquered that particular territory. By 1357, some of Bukka’s nephews had succeeded their fathers as governors of these provinces, and there was a possibility that the state would become less and less centralized as the various branches of the family became more firmly ensconced in their particular domains. Bukka, therefore, removed his nephews and replaced them with his sons and favorite generals so that centralized authority (and his own line of succession) could be maintained. However, the succession of Bukka’s son Harihara II (reigned 1377–1404) precipitated a repetition of the same action.
                   </p></div><p>A rebellion in the Tamil country at the beginning of his reign was probably was aided by the disaffected sons and officers of Bukka’s deceased eldest son, Kumara Kampana, who were not ready to acknowledge Harihara’s authority. Harihara was able to put down the rebellion and subsequently to replace his cousins with his own sons as governors of the colonies. Thus, the circle of power was narrowed once again. The question of succession to the throne had not been settled, however. On many occasions, the conflict resumed between the king and his lineal descendants, who tried to centralize the state, and the collateral relatives (cousins and brothers), who tried to establish ruling rights over some portions of the kingdom.
          
                    The temporary confusion that followed the assassination of the Bahmanī sultan ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn Mujāhid in 1378 gave Harihara the opportunity to recapture Goa and some other western ports and impose his authority southward along the Malabar Coast. During the next decade, pressure increased for expansion against the Reddi kingdom of Kondavidu in the northeast. Prince Devaraya captured Panagal fort and made it a base of operations in the region. The slight gains made in 1390–91 against an alliance of the Velama chieftain of Rajakonda and the Bahmanīs were more than offset when the Bahmanī sultan besieged Vijayanagar in 1398–99, slaughtered many people, and made a promise to pay tribute. The tribute was held two years later, however, when Vijayanagar made alliances with the sultans of Malwa and Gujarat. Nevertheless, Harihara’s reign was relatively successful, because he elaborated on the state, maintained internal order, and managed to fend off the Bahmanī sultans. The management of ports on both coasts provided opportunities for the acquisition of increased wealth through trade.
              </p></div>
                  <br>
                <h2>Wars and rivalries</h2>
                <h5>Title description, Sep 2, 2017</h5>
                <div class="row"><div class="col-7"><img src="_2.jpeg"></div><div class="col-5">
                <p>
                  Harihara II’s death in 1404 was followed by a violent succession dispute among his three surviving sons. Only after two of them had been crowned and dethroned was the third, Devaraya I (reigned 1406–22), able to emerge victoriously. Continuing 
                  instability, however, coupled with the involvement of Vijayanagar and the Bahmanī sultanate as backers of different claimants to the throne of Kondavidu, led to further confrontation between the two powers (each joined by various of the rivalrous 
                  Telugu chiefs). Sultan Fīrūz Shah Bahmanī supported a Reddi attack on Udayagiri. In a related move, the sultan himself mounted another siege of Vijayanagar city, imposing tributary conditions that included his marriage to Devaraya’s daughter. Despite 
                  Bahmanī successes, Vijayanagar managed to hold Panagal, Nalgonda, and other forts and to regain Udayagiri. The defeat of Fīrūz Shah in 1419 and the death of his Vema ally led to the eventual partition of Kondavidu between Vijayanagar and the Velamas of Rajakonda, who had switched sides with the Vegas during the protracted struggle. This extensive involvement in Andhra and Telingana—inspired by the ambition to expand farther up the eastern seaboard (an area that the Bahmanīs to the west also sought 
                  to control)—brought Vijayanagar into conflict for the first time with the kingdom of Orissa to the north. Although war was temporarily averted, there began a rivalry that was to last more than a century.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Perhaps Devaraya’s most significant achievement was his reorganization of the army. Realizing the value of cavalry and well-trained archers, he imported many horses from Persia and Arabia and hired Turkish bowmen, as well as troopers who were skilled in 
                  mounted warfare. Thus, although it appears that he was seldom able to best the Bahmanīs in the field, he had begun to narrow the strategic and technological gap between north and south and to build an army that would be better suited to warfare on open plains.
                  The short reigns of Devaraya’s two sons, Ramcandra and Vijaya, were disastrous. In a war against the Bahmanīs, many temples were destroyed, and Vijaya was forced to pay a huge indemnity. A combined invasion by the king of Orissa and the Velamas of Andhra resulted in the loss of the territories newly gained in the partition of the Reddi kingdom of Kondavidu.</p></div><p>
                 Vijaya’s son and successor, Devaraya II (reigned 1432–46), reconquered the lost Reddi territories and incorporated them into his kingdom, thus establishing the Krishna River as the northeastern boundary. Wars with the Bahmanīs in 1435–36 and 1443–44 over control of Raichur and Mudgal forts in the Tungabhadra-Krishna Doab ended inconclusively. Those campaigns, however, led to further improvements in Vijayanagar’s military forces when Devaraya II proclaimed that Muslims would be welcome in his service and assigned Muslim archers already in Vijayanagar's service to instruct his Hindu troops. Devaraya also levied tribute from Sri Lanka and campaigned successfully in the Kerala country of the far south, where his victories over local chieftains suggest a process of consolidation. His reign saw both the greatest territorial extension and the greatest centralization of the first period of the history of Vijayanagar.

                <h2>Decentralization and loss of territory</h2>
                <h5>Title description, Sep 2, 2017</h5>

                <p>
                  During the first 40 years after Devaraya’s death in 1446, the centralized power of the state declined, and a considerable amount of territory along both coasts was lost to the Bahmanī sultans and the suddenly powerful Gajapati ruler of Orissa. In the 1450s and 
                  ’60s Kapilendra (Kapileshvara), the great king of Orissa, together with his son Hamvira, conquered the Reddi kingdom of Rajahmundry and the Vijayanagar province of Kondavidu, captured Warangal and Bidar from the Bahmanīs, eventually occupied Udayagiri, and sent a 
                  victorious army down the east coast as far south as the Kaveri (Cauvery) River, where he was repulsed by the able Vijayanagar general and governor of Chandragiri, Saluva Narasimha.
                  The Orissan raid had a considerable effect on Vijayanagar. It not only weakened the empire in the east but also indicated that provincial governors might have to fend for themselves if they expected to retain their territories. The fact that Devaraya’s son Mallikarjuna 
                  (reigned 1446–65) was succeeded by a cousin rather than by his son was another indication of lessened central control and of the failure of the king and his immediate family to secure their future, as had been done by many of his ancestors when they removed their cousins from positions of power. The new ruler, Virupaksha (reigned 1465–85), had been a provincial governor. His usurpation was not accepted by many of the provincial governors on the east and west coasts or by the direct descendants of Mallikarjuna, who retired to the banks 
                  of the Kaveri and ruled much of the southern part of the kingdom in a semi-independent fashion.</p></div>
              <p>
                  
              </p>
              <p>
                  Beginning in 1470, the Bahmanīs, under the vizier Maḥmūd Gāwān, began a campaign that succeeded in taking much of the west coast and the northern Karnataka from Vijayanagar. The loss of Goa and other ports was especially disconcerting because it cut off not only an important source of trade and state income but the principal source of supply of Middle Eastern horses for the military as well. The death in 1470 of Kapilendra of Orissa temporarily relieved military pressure in the east; but it was Saluva Narasimha (since transferred to Penukonda), rather than Virupaksha, who took advantage of the resultant civil war in Orissa to regain lost territory. He reconquered the Tamil region and became master of the east coast up to the Godavari River. Bahmanī aid to Hamvira, in return for the surrender of all the captured forts in Telingana, drew Narasimha into a war with the sultanate. A two-pronged attack by Muḥammad Shah and Maḥmūd Gāwān on Narasimha’s territories—Penukonda and the coastal region—and the plunder of Kanchipuram in 1481 were only temporarily successful, for Ishvara Nayaka, a Vijayanagar general, recovered the loot from the returning Bahmanī 
                  forces at Kandukur, and Narasimha recaptured Penukonda after turning back the Bahmanī forces.

                <h2>Empire's peak, defeat, and decline</h2>
                <h5>Title description, Sep 2, 2017</h5>
                <div class="row"><div class="col-7"><img src="_4.jpeg"></div><div class="col-5">
                <p>
                  The empire reached its peak during the rule of Krishna Deva Raya when Vijayanagara armies were consistently victorious. The empire gained territory formerly under the Sultanates in the northern Deccan, such as Raichur and Gulbarga from the Bahamani Sultanate, territories in the eastern Deccan from wars with 
                  Sultan Quli Qutb Shahi of Golkonda, and Kalinga region from the Gajapatis of Odisha. This was in addition to the already established presence in the southern Deccan. Many important monuments were either completed or commissioned during the time of King Krishnadevaraya.
                  Krishna Deva Raya was succeeded by his younger half-brother Achyuta Deva Raya in 1529. When Achyuta Deva Raya died in 1542, Sadashiva Raya, the teenage nephew of Achyuta Raya, was appointed king, and Aliya Rama Raya, Krishna Deva Raya's son-in-law, became the caretaker. When Sadashiva Raya was old enough to assert his independent claim over the throne, Aliya Rama Raya made him a virtual prisoner and became the de facto ruler. He hired Muslim generals in his army from his previous diplomatic connections with the Sultanates and called himself "Sultan of the World". He was keen on interfering 
                  in the internal affairs of the various Sultanates and on playing off the Muslim powers against one another while making himself the ruler of the most powerful and influential regional power. This worked for a while but eventually made him very unpopular among his people and the Muslim rulers. He made a 
                  commercial treaty with the Portuguese whereby the supply of horses to Bijapur was stopped, then defeated the Bijapur ruler and inflicted humiliating defeats on Golconda and Ahmednagar.
                  Eventually, the Sultanates to the north of Vijayanagara united and attacked Aliya Rama Raya's army in January 1565 in the Battle of Talikota. Regarding the Vijayanagara defeat in battle, Kamath opines that the Sultanate armies, though numerically disadvantaged, were better equipped and trained. Their artillery was manned by expert Turkish gunmen while the Vijayanagara army depended on European mercenaries using outdated artillery. The Sultanate cavalry rode fast-moving Persian horses and used spikes that were fifteen to sixteen feet long giving them a greater reach, and their archers used metal crossbows which enabled them to reach longer distance targets. In comparison, the Vijayanagara army depended on slow-moving war elephants, a cavalry riding mostly locally bred weaker horses wielding shorter reach javelins, and their archers used traditional bamboo bows with a shorter range. 
          </p></div>
                  <p>Despite these disadvantages, Kamath, Hermann Kulke 
                    , and Dietmar Rothermund concur that the vast Vijayanagara army appeared to have the upper hand until two Muslim generals (identified as the mercenary Gilani brothers according to Kamath) switched sides and joined forces with the Sultanates turning the tide decisively in favor of the Sultanates. The generals captured Aliya 
                    Rama Raya and beheaded him, and Sultan Hussain had the severed head stuffed with straw for display. Aliya Rama Raya's beheading created confusion and havoc in the Vijayanagara army, which was then completely routed. The Sultanates' army plundered Hampi and reduced it to the ruinous state in which it remains today.
                      After Aliya Rama Raya's death, Tirumala Deva Raya started the Aravidu dynasty, founded a new capital of Penukonda to replace the destroyed Hampi, and attempted to reconstitute the remains of the Vijayanagara Empire.[60] Tirumala abdicated in 1572, dividing the remains of his kingdom to his three sons. The Aravidu dynasty successors ruled the region but the empire collapsed in 1614, and the final remains ended in 1646, from continued wars with the Bijapur sultanate and others. During this period, more kingdoms in South India became independent and separate from Vijayanagara, including the Mysore Kingdom, Keladi Nayaka, Nayaks of Madurai, 
                      Nayaks of Tanjore, Nayakas of Chitradurga and Nayak Kingdom of Gingee.
