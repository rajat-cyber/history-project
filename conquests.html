    <h2 class="title">Conquests</h2>
    <p>In 1336 Harihara, with the help of his brother, held uneasy suzerainty over lands extending from nellore, on the southeast coast, to 
        Badami, south of Bijapur on the western side of the Deccan. All around him new Hindu kingdoms were rising, the most important of which were the 
        Hoysala kingdom of Ballala and the Andhra confederacy, led by Kapaya Nayaka. However, Ballala's kingdom was disadvantageously 
        situated between the Ma'bar sultanate and Vijayanagar, and within two years after Ballala was killed by the sultan in 1343-44, his kingdom had been conquered by 
        Bukka, Harihara's brother, and annexed to Vijayanagar. This was the most important 
        victory of Harihara's reign; the new state now could claim sovereignty from sea to sea, and in 1346 the five brothers attended a great celebration at which Bukka was made joint ruler and heir.</p>
        <p>Harihara’s brothers made other, less significant conquests of small Hindu kingdoms during the next decade. However, the foundation of the Bahmanī sultanate in 1347 created a new and greater danger, and Harihara was forced to lessen his own expansionist activities to meet the threat posed by this powerful and aggressive new state on his northern borders. During Harihara’s reign the administrative foundation of the Vijayanagar state was laid. Borrowing from the Kakatiya kings he had served, he created administrative units called stholas, nadus, and simas and appointed officials to collect revenue and to carry on local administration, preferring Brahmans to men of other castes. The income of the state apparently was increased by the reorganization, although centralization probably did not proceed to the stage where salaried officials collected directly for the government in most areas. Rather, most land remained under the direct control of subordinate chiefs or of a hierarchy of local landholders, who paid some revenue and provided some troops for the king. Harihara also encouraged increased cultivation in some areas by allowing lower revenue payments for lands recently reclaimed from the forests.
